## Configuration options

The colour of the accordionsâ€™ title text can be overridden, though blue is more commonly recognised as a link colour.

```scss
$accordion__header-colour
```

Your value for this should be included before you include the SCSS file.

```scss
$accordion__header-colour: red;
@import '/path/to/components/accordion/accordion';
```
