## Reduced gaps between grid areas

The gaps between category list items in a grid can be reduced using the `ds_category-list--narrow` modifier alongside the `ds_category-list--grid` class.

It must only be used when cards are used as the category list items.

## Colour guidelines

### Category items

The transparent background inherits the background colour of the parent element.

### Cards

Cards should use a different colour to the background for increased contrast:

- White cards when on a light grey background
- Grey cards when on a white background
