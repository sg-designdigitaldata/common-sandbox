# Notes

Both the summary text content and the image are optional.

## Variants

### Background colour
The component has a grey background (by default) and padding is added around the text content.

If you use a dark background colour, add the class `ds_reversed` to make the text white.

Can be used in combination with "wide."


### Wide
The text content takes up 2/3 of the available space; the image takes up 1/3.

Can be used in combination with "grey."

### Full image

The image is applied across the entire component. Text is overlaid on top of the image.

Gives the text a solid white background and aligns the text content to the upper left of the component.

Can be used in combination with "wide."
