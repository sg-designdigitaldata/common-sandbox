## Pagination for smaller display widths

Limit the number of pagination links shown at once, to reduce the chances of wrapping on multiple lines at smaller widths.

## Load more results
An alternative approach is to replace the pagination links with a 'load more' button at smaller widths and dynamically show additional content each time the button is triggered.

Additional research is needed on whether this approach should be used at all viewport widths for consistency and not just on smaller widths.
