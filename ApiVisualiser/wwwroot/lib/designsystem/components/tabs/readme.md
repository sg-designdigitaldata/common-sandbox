## Types of tab

There are two distinct types of tab that share a common visual style at larger viewport widths:

- **Dynamic tabs** where the tabs change only the contents of the panel under the tabs
- **Navigation tabs** where the tabs are links to different pages

### Dynamic tabs

Further research is needed on whether including the number of items within each tab as part of the tab labels is understood by users.

Unless there is user evidence proving otherwise for a particular use case, dynamic tabs should include a border around the selected tab's content panel.

### Navigation tabs

Only one set of navigation tabs should be used on a page to help users understand that have changed to a different page.

A set of navigation tabs should be consistently placed on every page they are used.
