If you need a Codespace not linked to any particular project or code repo, this is the place for you!

There are two dev containers to choose from. A .NET 8 (C#) environment, and a Node.js environment. If it makes sense, we could merge these.

Codespaces are configured to use the 4-core machine type (second lowest) by default. This balances cost and performance.
